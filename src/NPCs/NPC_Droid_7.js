Thank you, stranger friend!
You saved my life!
[b]Vagrant Droid #7[/b]
That was very kind and altruist of you.
You must feel great for what you did!
[b]Vagrant Droid #7[/b]
That makes you a vagrant; acting for your own
benefit, first and foremost.
[b]Vagrant Droid #7[/b]
Hmm? Did I say anything strange?
In any case, please tell me your name.
[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
My name is `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.

[b]K4N7[/b]
I'm pleasured to meet you, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
My name is K4N7. I'm a vagrant, like you!
[b]K4N7[/b]
I'm really thankful that your ethic logic drove
you to save me; if you were like the others here,
[b]K4N7[/b]
I would have been destroyed for sure. That makes me
wonder, though, why would you save me? Why do you
[b]K4N7[/b]
act the way you do? You may say you're an altruist
for helping others in need, but you still had a
[b]K4N7[/b]
personal interest in helping me, right? You saved
me because that made you feel good, you did what
[b]K4N7[/b]
you felt must be done, for there is nothing higher
than reason, that's what makes you a vagrant!
[b]K4N7[/b]
Yo did help me for your own sake, indeed, but that
it's not bad. The death of dogma is the birth of
[b]K4N7[/b]
morality, and in your own benefit I can find mine
too. That's how everyone should be! Yes!
[b]K4N7[/b]
I didn't really know what I was searching in this
tower, but now that I have reached this conclusion,
[b]K4N7[/b]
I think I can find the meaning in my immortal life
and decisions, everything thanks to you, who
[b]K4N7[/b]
dares to make use of reason to defy the madness
of this world for your own existencial benefit!
[b]K4N7[/b]
Please, allow me to gift you this plugin weapon,
for I must reward this meeting with you:
OBTAINED PLUGIN WEAPON: LASER CANNON


[b]K4N7[/b]
This plugin will allow you to fire a powerful
laser that will melt away your enemies!
[b]K4N7[/b]
Be minfdul that you cannot fire this laser
indefinitely, for it consumes energy.
[b]K4N7[/b]
Now that I have obtained enlightenement,
I can leave Starvail Tower, thanks to you.
[b]K4N7[/b]
Never be afraid of the shadows of this world,
`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`. For you have the enlightenement of
[b]K4N7[/b]
reason that will guide you to the right places,
to the right choices, just like it happened
[b]K4N7[/b]
here. Good luck in your journey, take care!`;
