Thanks, vagrant droid!
You really saved me there.
[b]Vagrant Droid #6[/b]
It's a relief that I can rely on others
saving my ass, so I don't need to be strong...
[b]Vagrant Droid #6[/b]
Oh, sorry! I was thinking out loud. What I
really mean is that it's good to have droids
[b]Vagrant Droid #6[/b]
like you, willing to help others.
What is the name of my savior?
[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
My name is `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.

[b]JUN6[/b]
It's a pleasure, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
I'm known as JUN6.
[b]JUN6[/b]
Sorry for what I said earlier. I don't really
think that way. Or, to be more precise, I don't
[b]JUN6[/b]
want to think that way. The reason I came to this
tower is because I wanted to change, be more brave.
[b]JUN6[/b]
But in reality, to do so, I must face my shadows,
I must accept them as a part of me, in order
[b]JUN6[/b]
to be true and to be able to change. This
near death-experience helped me realize that.
[b]JUN6[/b]
Do you know why us vagrants are scared of death?
It is because we see ourselves as individuals; we
[b]JUN6[/b]
value that individuality. However, our human
creators gave up individuality long ago, when
[b]JUN6[/b]
they ascended to a higher plane, becoming one
with the absolute 'Self' that conformed all their
[b]JUN6[/b]
minds, becoming the individuality of them all.
This choice was based on the idea that human
[b]JUN6[/b]
interaction stimulates mutual growth. This
seemed confusing at first, but in meeting you
[b]JUN6[/b]
I feel I have found the change I was searching
for! I understand now. Thanks, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
[b]JUN6[/b]
In return, I want you to evolve as well.
Please, accept this gift:
OBTAINED PLUGIN WEAPON: CLUSTER MISSILES


[b]JUN6[/b]
These missiles will release small bombs on
detonation, causing massive, multiple damage!
[b]JUN6[/b]
On pair with their destructive power is their
energy cost, so be sure to use them wisely.
[b]JUN6[/b]
Finally, I think I can leave this tower in peace.
I don't really need to see the birth of the new
[b]JUN6[/b]
star anymore, because it didn't really meant
anything for me in the first place.
[b]JUN6[/b]
On the other hand, facing death and meeting you
has given my life a new, truer, meaning.
[b]JUN6[/b]
After all, the meeting of two personalities is
like the contact of two chemical substances;
[b]JUN6[/b]
if there is any reaction, both are transformed.
Thank you again, and farewell, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`!`;
