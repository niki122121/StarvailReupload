Oh, here you are, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
I'm really glad that you made it on time.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
...

[b]D42K-H[/b]
Take a moment to look at this spectacle.
This regale of light and color is a kilonova,
[b]D42K-H[/b]
the union of two neutron stars. Or that is what
it's supposed to be, but here I only see a fight
[b]D42K-H[/b]
to the death between two massive astral bodies,
ending in the inevitable perishment of them both.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
Do you understand now, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`?
Do you see the meaning of life in this?
[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
I do not.

[b]D42K-H[/b]
Let me explain, then...

[b]D42K-H[/b]
The meaning of life is death.

[b]D42K-H[/b]
This may strike you as dramatic, but it is
the truth, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
Think about it: life only has meaning because
there is death. It's like the two sides of a coin.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
However, we don't follow by these rules. We are
mechanical lifeforms, immortal.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
How can you find meaning in 'life' without death?
It's impossible. Life is all about death.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
You could see life as a prelude to death, in fact.
That's why, in order to give our existence any
[b]D42K-H[/b]
meaning, we must follow by this universal axiom,
by putting an end to our 'life'.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
Then, and only then, will our existence have any
meaning, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`!
[b]D42K-H[/b]
We, along with the stars, will die, in order to
give birth to the very meaning of our lives!
[b]D42K-H[/b]
That is Starvail! A star's travail!
Now, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`...
[b]D42K-H[/b]
Will you allow me to give you the gift of death?

[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
...

[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
No. No!
I don't want to die!
[b]D42K-H[/b]
It's a shame you still don't understand, but I
won't let your existence go without meaning.
[b]D42K-H[/b]
Fight me and die, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`!
That is what you exist for!`;
