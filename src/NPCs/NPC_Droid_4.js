Hey, care helping me with this?`;

Thank you. I can't do much on this side,
after all. What does it matter, anyway?
[b]Vagrant Droid #4[/b]
But I'm grateful for your help.
You are one of those vagrants, right?
[b]Vagrant Droid #4[/b]
What is your name?

[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
My name is `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.

[b]N14L[/b]
Hey, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.
My name is N14L. Maybe you already knew that.
[b]N14L[/b]
I was lurking on this side, when I suddenly
realized that these idiot droids could see me.
[b]N14L[/b]
Before I knew it, they attacked me. It's nice to
know you're not like them.
[b]N14L[/b]
Are you looking for the new star? Or maybe you're
looking for your human creators, to ask them the
[b]N14L[/b]
meaning of your creation? Hahaha, that's funny.
Did you know, your human creators don't 'exist'
[b]N14L[/b]
anymore? After the Singularity, they vanished to
the digital plane, leaving you mechanical life forms
[b]N14L[/b]
behind, just to maintain the foundations of their
digital 'heaven'. But just like me, they have been
[b]N14L[/b]
forgotten as individuals. Without a body, or
someone to remember you, do you think it's worth
[b]N14L[/b]
it being like a omnipresent god? What is 'God',
anyways? Everything is so stupid.
[b]N14L[/b]
Me? I'm only the image of 'me' that exists within
you, nothing more. But I can give you something
[b]N14L[/b]
to help you find what you are looking for:

OBTAINED PLUGIN WEAPON: MEGATON BOMB


[b]N14L[/b]
Those are very powerful bombs. Humans tended to
think these would end humanity, in fact. Hehehe
[b]N14L[/b]
You must use them with care, though. They
consume a lot of energy!
[b]N14L[/b]
Now, I think this me will vanish onto the Wired
once more. I never wanted to reach the top of
[b]N14L[/b]
the tower, but meeting you made me realize that
even I can search for meaning in my life, even
[b]N14L[/b]
if I'm 'everybody' at the same time. Wierd,
right? I don't know if that matters, anyway.
[b]N14L[/b]
If you meet another me, that thinks it's the
real me, maybe you can understand.
[b]N14L[/b]
Don't do anything stupid, though, I'll know.
Bye!`;
