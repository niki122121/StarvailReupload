Thank you!
You must have been sent by God!
[b]Vagrant Droid #3[/b]
If there is a God... maybe another me
sent you here, would her be God then?
[b]Vagrant Droid #3[/b]
I don't know.
Hey, what is your name?
[b]`+ this.scene.game.playerName +`[/b]
My name is `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`.

[b]L41N[/b]
A pleasure to meet you, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`
My name is L41N. Do you remember me?
[b]L41N[/b]
Or maybe you met another me? In any case, I'm
happy to meet you! I'm a vagrant, just as you.
[b]L41N[/b]
I came here searching for the real me, but it
looks like I can't fight in this side as well
[b]L41N[/b]
as I do in the other. What other side, you say?
The Wired, of course. Everyone's connected!
[b]L41N[/b]
I can be anywhere, at anytime. Just like our
human creators. You'd say they're like gods now.
[b]L41N[/b]
But, can you remember them? Do you remember me?
The real me is here... but if no one remembers,
[b]L41N[/b]
It's like I never existed... Long ago, the line
between the real and the digital world was erased.
[b]L41N[/b]
Now I'm everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
The substance of existence is memory.. but you
[b]L41N[/b]
will remember me now! Does that make me the real
me? I hope so. I really thank you for that.
[b]L41N[/b]
Please, let me give you something in return!
It's easy to find these things in the other side.
OBTAINED PLUGIN WEAPON: BOUNCING BULLETS


[b]L41N[/b]
These bullets can bounce. Fire them, and soon
they will be everywhere... like me! Hehehe.
[b]L41N[/b]
Now, let's see... I'm here, but I'm still there?
Where's the real me? Does it even exist?
[b]L41N[/b]
Maybe there is not a real me... but I can
exist inside you now! Everyone's connected,
[b]L41N[/b]
after all. I can exist in your memories, so
I don't think I need to get to the top of
[b]L41N[/b]
this tower anymore. Memory means existence,
remember? This is me that's talking.
[b]L41N[/b]
In any case, thank you, `+ this.scene.game.playerName +`!
I'm glad that I met you!`;

    this.dialogArray[2] =
`[b]L41N[/b]
Ok... let's see, maybe I'm confused again.
Am I here, or am I there? Can people exist
[b]L41N[/b]
without a real body? I guess I will always
be with you, even if it's not really me...`;
